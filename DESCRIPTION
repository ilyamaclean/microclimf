Description: The functions in the microclimf package contain tools for 
    fast modelling of the mechanistic processes that govern below or above canopy
    microclimate on gridded data. It builds on the microclima and microclimc packages, but 
    contains all the functions needed to run the model in isolation, with no other 
    microclimate package dependancies. A simplified means of estimating soil temperatures is 
    included, eliminating the need to run the model in time-steps. In consequences calculations
    are performed simultaniously on all grid cells and over all time-increments. The models
    can be run either in hourly or in daily time-increments, the latter quicker with with lower
    memory requirements. In interpolation method to derive hourly estimates from daily data is 
    also included.

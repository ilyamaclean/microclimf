\value{
a list with the following components:

`tcan` the leaf or effective canopy temperature (deg C)

`H` the sensible heat flux (w/m^2)

`HR` hte fractional of net radiation that is sensible heat

Optionally `L` The latent heat flux (W/m^2)

Optionally `G` The ground heat flux (W/m^2)
}
\description{
The function `PenMont` applies a varient of the Penman-Monteith
equation, to calculate latent heat and canopy heat exchange surface
temperature
}
\details{
`Latent` can be used to calaculate either the latent heat of
evapotranspiration from individual leaves or bulk surface latent heat of
evapotranspiration from the canopy as a whole depending on how `gHa` and `gs`
are defined. If for the canopy as a whole, heat storage `G` should also be
considered and `L` is the Latent heat per unit leaf area and should thus be
multiplied by the total leaf area per unit ground area to derive a total. If
for a leaf in isolation, set g0 to zero and T0 to an arbitrary value. The
paramater `surfwet` determines how much of the canopy should be treated as
wet surface. However, except when extremely droughted, the matric potential of
leaves is such that `surfwet` ~ 1.

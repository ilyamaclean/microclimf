\arguments{
\item{microd}{an object of class `microindaily` as returned by [modelin_dy()]}

\item{reqhgt}{height above ground at which model outputs are needed (m).}

\item{xyf}{optional input for called function [wind()]}

\item{zf}{optional input for called function [wind()]}

\item{tfact}{coefficient determining sensitivity of soil moisture to variation
in topographic wetness (see [soilmdistribute()]).}

\item{slr}{an optional RasterLayer of slope values (Radians). Calculated from
dtm if not supplied, but outer cells will be NA.}

dtm if not supplied, but outer cells will be NA.}

\item{hor}{an optional array of the tangent of the angle to the horizon in
24 directions. Calculated from dtm if not supplied, but outer cells will be NA.}

\item{wsa}{an optional array of wind shelter coefficients in 8 directions.
Calculated from dtm if not supplied, but outer cells will be NA.}

\item{maxhgt}{an optional height (m) for which wind speed is needed. Determined
from height of tallest vegetation or as 2 m, whichever is greater, if not supplied.}

\item{twi}{optional raster of topographic wetness index values.
Calculated from `dtm` of not supplied, but outer cells will be NA.}

\value{
an object of class micro with the following components added:

`T0` ground surface temperature (deg C)

`theta` surface soil moisture fraction

additional terms needed for subsequent modelling.

The function `soiltemp_dy` estimates ground surface temperature
}
\details{
if [groundrad()] has not been run to add additional elements to `micro`
it is automatically called.
